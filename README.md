AI-Driven Personalized Learning Assistant
HackHub 2025 – Global Hackathon | 51 Hours
Overview
This project was developed during HackHub 2025, a 51-hour global hackathon. The solution is an AI-powered learning assistant designed to help students optimize their study schedules by analyzing their timetable, academic performance, and learning patterns.

The system recommends personalized study plans, tracks progress, and suggests resources to improve weak subjects — aiming to reduce study-time inefficiency and enhance academic performance.

Key Features
AI-Powered Recommendations – Machine learning model predicts weak subjects and recommends targeted study time.
Automated Timetable Sync – Imports class schedules and finds optimal free study slots.
Progress Tracking Dashboard – Visualizes study time, performance trends, and subject-wise progress.
Secure Authentication – Encrypted user login using bcrypt for password hashing.
Responsive Web Interface – Built for mobile & desktop users.

Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: PHP, Python (Flask for AI Model)

Database: MySQL

Machine Learning: Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy)

My Role
Developed the backend APIs (PHP + MySQL) for timetable and user data management.

Designed the AI recommendation engine using Python, improving weak-topic prediction accuracy by ~25% in testing.

Created a mobile-friendly UI with React, improving usability across devices.

Collaborated with a 4-member team on rapid prototyping, algorithm design, and presentation.

Results
Reduced timetable conflicts and idle time by ~30%.

Helped students prioritize weak subjects, improving study efficiency by ~20% (test simulations).
